# automationphat-mqtt
Reads Automation pHAT ADC inputs and GPIO IOs and sends it to MQTT server.
Allows controlling outputs via MQTT.
Requires Pimoroni automationphat libraries.
Enables (easy?) integration to for example Home Assistant.

## Suggested hardware:  
Raspberry Pi Zero-W with Raspberry OS (former Raspbian). Pimoroni [Automation
pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-phat) (discontinued). 

As automation pHAT is disconued, iÂ´m planning to add support for at least
[Automation HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat)
which i have...

Latest
[Automation HAT Mini](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat-mini)
should also be partly supported, but i haven't tested it.

## Usage
Create python venv if desired. Clone the repository. 
Copy automationphat-mqtt.conf.example to automationphat-mqtt.conf
and modify as needed. Install requirements from requirements.txt. Run.
For usage with home assistant see following example.

## Example home assistant configuration.yaml entry:
